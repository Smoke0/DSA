In java to sort object classes we can use two ways 
1. Comparable
2. Comparator

1. Comparable makes object comparable to other object basis on some property, we need to override the compareTo method and then we can use
Collection.sort() or Collection.sort( Collections.reverseOrder()). Here we compare this to other object

2. Comparator is more powerfull we implement this as a seprate class we can make different class based on diff parameters like a movie class we can implement sorting based on name, rating, year etc.

class NameBasedComparator implements Comparator<>{
}

class RatingBasedComparator implements Comparator<>{
}

then we can pass Collections.sort( , new NameBasedComparator() ) or Collections.sort( , new RatingBasedComparator() ) 

here we compare two diff object passed by overriding compare() method as it's a seprate class we can do much complex sorting by implementing diif methods.
